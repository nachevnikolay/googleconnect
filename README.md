Gmail automation test framework

Here is a good first stab at a building an extensible test automation framework with C# using Selenium and Gmail as the ginnea pig test subject.



TODO: 

1. Add TDD capability 
     Json file with test cases 
     Test runner engine
2. Add loging

3. Add some more unit test coverage for the framework itself

4. Add verification helper methods 

4. Use Google APIs to build a set of shims to be able to log in and modify 
email content without the UI for faster and more stable automation

5. Start adding Test suites and test cases covering Gmail functionality
